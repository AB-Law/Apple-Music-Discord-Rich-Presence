<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project


I made this so as to show what music I was playing on Discord. Spotify has an in-built integration with Discord, so I wanted to build a somewhat similar integration, at least one in which you could see what I was listening to at the time.

Multiple icon support (changes icons mid song)

- [Discord Rich Presence](https://discord.com/rich-presence)
